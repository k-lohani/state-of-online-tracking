Nowadays, trackers are incorporated on websites. These trackers

• 83% of the analyzed websites

collect data under the pretense of improving the user experience. use 10 or fewer trackers

They are, however, used to profile a user's attributes and behaviors byanalyzing location history, browsing history, and other data to deduce

Policymakers can use this study to design laws for online tracking. unique trackers.

Another application could be to develop sophisticated tracker

blockers.

• Russian websites use the least

number of unique trackers.
